I'm Lslightly, a CS graduate at USTC. I have broad interests and I just seek time to start them or I have not found available resources to do them.

Beliefs:

- Believe Myself.
- Coding and Practice.
- Keep Improving like Vim.
- Offer Helps and Make Sense.
- Cooperation creates. Races have no winners.
- Seeking/Creating the Good in Life.

After graduation, I got emo because I thought I didn't find my value. But actually it was there: trying new things and some practical tools.
